# Offline-Home-Automation-System
The objective of this project is to get rid of the requirement for internet connection by handling voice instructions locally.
This setup utilizes an Arduino microcontroller linked to a nearby voice recognition module, like the Grove Voice Recognition sensor (VC02), to detect and handle simple voice commands on the device itself. The objective of the system is to manage devices such as lights or fans through the identification of particular phrases.In this project we have include 15 commands and 4 devices which includes charging port
